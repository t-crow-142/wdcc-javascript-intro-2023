        <h3>General information:</h3>
        <p>
            All the instructions for the exercises in these sessions are included in the HTML file within which you will also run the exercises and examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will see that each individual page will have a matching JavaScript file within which you can write your code for each exercise. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can edit the code for the files with any code editor; however, it is recommended that you use Visual Studio Code as this is what will be used in the live demonstrations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only be aiming to cover the content for 3 of the sessions today; however, there is extra content in the slides and extra exercises available for those who want to spend more time on JavaScript after the workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can browse between the examples and exercises for each of the four sessions with the navigation links above. 
        </p>
        <h3>Slides:</h3>
        <p>
            The slides for all sessions have been merged into a single Google Slides document and they can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BzY_5h_nt_UVLq-JZcjyXb7-OPKqELn8AP4gjA2sNTo/edit?usp=sharing">LINK TO SLIDES</a>.
        </p>
